'''Solidity Functions 

Blocks of reusable code. Like mini-programs inside your contract.
Perform specific actions: modify state, calculate values, interact with other contracts.
Defined with function keyword.
Can have:
parameters: inputs you give the function.
return values: outputs the function gives back.
visibility: who can call it (public, internal, private, external).
state mutability: how it interacts with the blockchain state (view, pure, payable).
Essential for making contracts dynamic and interactive!
