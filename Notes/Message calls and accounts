''' Solidity: Message Calls & Accounts 

Accounts: Like digital identities on the blockchain. Two main types:

Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs): Controlled by private keys (think your crypto wallet). Can initiate transactions.

Contract Accounts: Controlled by their code. Can only execute code in response to transactions or other message calls.

Message Calls: How accounts interact. An EOA sends a transaction to trigger a function in a contract, or one contract can call a function in another contract.

msg object: Special global variable in Solidity providing info about the current message call:

msg.sender: The address of the account that initiated the call.

msg.value: The amount of Ether sent with the call (if any).
msg.data: The raw bytes of the function call and its arguments.
Gas: Message calls cost gas (ETH) to execute, especially when modifying the blockchain's state.
